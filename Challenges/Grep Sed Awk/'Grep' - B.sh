#Given an input file, with N credit card numbers, each in a new line, your task is to grep out and output only those credit card numbers which have two or more consecutive occurences of the same digit (which may be separated by a space, if they are in different segments). Assume that the credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each.

grep '\([0-9]\) *\1'
